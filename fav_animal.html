    <p>A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1-1.5 kg (1-3 lb),
         while larger ones can weigh up to 7-11 kg (15-23 lb). All healthy 
         puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as
          the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the 
          Yorkshire Terrier. In vernacular English, puppy refers specifically
           to dogs, while pup may often be used for other mammals such as seals,
            giraffes, guinea pigs, or even rats.</p>
